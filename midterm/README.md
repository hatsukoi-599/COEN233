# Midterm

# Description

Do Assignment #1, p 175, of textbook. Use the resources mentioned in the text if you wish.

Follow standard submission guidelines, with the directory name as below. No late submission accepted.

1. Your unzip directory name should be csen233midterm<last><first>. For example, my directory name will be csen233midtermWangSinYaw. Name your main program the same, with ".py" extension (csen233midtermWangSinYaw.py). Create as many Python modules as you wish. Do not use any modules not in the standard Python installation. I will test by typing "python3 <your main file name>" and bring up a browser to connect as in #5 below.

2. Do not use port 80. (I suggest 8100 or higher.) Hardcode this port in your code. Display to the screen an URL to connect to this web server when your program starts.

3. As in text book, expect an HTTP GET request from a client.

4. Reply with arbitrary contents. Ignore the "file" from the client as you please. Randomly at 50% probability, return an error of your choice.

5. Test by using a standard browser, from the same computer, to connect to the URL as #2. We expect the browser to display error 50% of the times. If you wish, test by running the browser from a different computer.

6. Name your log file as the main program (see #1). I expect sufficient logging, with timestamps and in a file, to account for the sequence of events happened on the server side.
