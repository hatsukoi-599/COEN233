# @Usage
# To execute this program, simply run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
# python dijkstra.py <topology_file> <source_router_name> <dest_router_name>
# Example: python dijkstra.py R01 R20

# Note: The implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm is based on the provided code, which assumes unique router names for each node. 
# Consequently, the algorithm does not account for scenarios involving duplicate router names, such as (R01, R01). 
# Please ensure that each router has a distinct name for testing purposes

# @Description:
# This script takes the second and third command-line arguments as the source and destination router names, respectively.
# Before simulating packet forwarding, it invokes the Dijkstra algorithm from HW7 to compute the shortest path between the two routers for reference.
# The negative tests primarily focus on attempting to sendData to a destination that does not exist in the FIB. 
# For this purpose, a router name is generated randomly, and sendData is called with this generated name as the destination.
# You should expect to see the packet being dropped in both the stdout and the logfile.
