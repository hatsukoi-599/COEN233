# Homework5 Zero Knowledge Key Exchange

## Description

Study Diffie-Hellman algorithmLinks to an external site.. The wikipedia link is not the totality of Diffie-Hellman description. You should reach an understanding level to be able to explain to a layman how this algorithm works and why it is secure. Implement a protocol that your team designs and do key exchanges with your partner. (For group with three members, do 3 pair-wise attempts.)

The idea is not to achieve security, but for you to understand a zero-knowledge key exchange concept. It is not for you to generate a cryptographically strong encryption key. Do not make lives complicated unnecessarily.

Do "simple Diffie-Hellman". Do not try the more secure versions. Do only "two-party key exchange." The length, in terms of number of digits, for the final shared secret is not a consideration for this homework.

This homework is then:

Design a key exchange protocol. It should be a "one pager."
Each person on the team to implement the protocol separately.
Test implementations with your team members. Revise protocol as you see fit.
Submit the protocol doc (in PDF or plain text), all members' code, and all members' log files. Package the submission as one zip/tar file that unpack into one directory that's compliant to the guidelines.
Failure to be compliant to the submission guidelines will lose 30% of the credits from now on. Test your packaging before you submit.
